## player stats endpoint

player endpoint is [https://v3.football.api-sports.io/players](https://v3.football.api-sports.io/players)
requires the season and league param to search for a player name

## notes for updating stats

api-football has an endpoint for stats from the last match ---
[https://v3.football.api-sports.io/fixtures/players](https://v3.football.api-sports.io/fixtures/players)

we have to get the team ID for the player, then send request to /fixtures endpoint to get the last fixture id, then send fixture id and team id to fixtures/players, and parse that JSON response for the data for the specific player we are searching for.... oh my.

## ideas

can we store fav players in localStorage?
use localStorage/seesionStorage to track if user is logged in
